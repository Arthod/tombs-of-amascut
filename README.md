# Tombs of Amascut

Utilities and information for raiding the Tombs of Amascut.

**Note: While Tombs of Amascut is new, Jagex will be quite strict on what is and is not allowed in ToA plugins.**
Feel free to request new features in the Issues tab (after searching for an existing matching issue),
or follow a discussion there on whether a feature should be implemented.

### Current Features

#### Invocation Presets

Right-click the Preset button to create/load/import/export presets.
Invocations that need to be changed will be highlighted green/red.

*Flicker is a known issue due to the panel redrawing itself after being clicked.
I am working on an alternative solution.*

#### Deposit-pickaxe Swap

While holding a pickaxe, swaps the left-click option to "Deposit-pickaxe"
on the statue in the mirror puzzle room.
